   "source": [
    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _**Gaussian Naive Bayes**_:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example**: Naive Bayes is very popular in commercial and open-source anti-spam e-mail filters [(Metsis, et al., 2006)](http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/ceas2006_paper.pdf). In other words classifying if an email should be cosidered as spam or not. Many times a textual analysis is carried out and probabilities of certain words or headers are taken into account as atributes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Advantages**: It's simple to implement and has a linear computational complexity (Metsis, et al., 2006). Basically you're just doing counts. It performs best when independence between attributes holds, as it is its basic assumption. Moreover it still performs well in practice, even if conditional indpendence of the variables doesn't hold, which is a huge advantage considering that's rarely the case in the real world.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Disadvantages**: One important disadvantage is that it can’t learn relationships between features, as it assumes independence between them. Another issue is that if you have no occurrences of a class label and a certain attribute value together (class=\"passed\", travel_time=\"50\") then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero when the porbabilities of the variables are multiplied, even though in reality there might be instances left out of the data set, that have these occurrences of the class and a specific attribute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Why good for problem**: Naive Bayes is one of the most effective, efficient and competitive machine learning algorithms for classification [(Zhang, 2004)](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf). Which is the problem we are dealing here with. Secondly given we are asked to this this as optimally as possible, the low computational requirements make it a good fit for this case too. Finally as seen in the section \"Correlation between Variables\", I've computed the 80th percentile of all correlations between variables, where the maximum value was 0.19. This indicates that the majority of the variables have low correlation (hence low indpendence), which is a good indication for using naive Bayes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. _**Decision Trees**_:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example**: Automated star/galaxy classification [(Weir, et al., 1995)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Djorgovski/publication/234223141_Automated_StarGalaxy_Classification_for_Digitized_Poss-II/links/554bc71c0cf29752ee7eba39.pdf). Decision treess were used here to classify objects in the sky as stars or distant galaxies depending on radius of the object, elipticity and others. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Advantages**: Complex data can be easily presented in a decision tree and decision trees do not require any assumptions of linearity in the data. Also if the data is not overlapping much (i.e. the classes are very distinct) they can perfomr very well even with a low depth.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Disadvantages**:  DTs have is they are high variance classifiers i.e. the DT learnt is sensitive to the precise layout of points and, if you have less data, can fit to noise. In other words DTs don't perform well when there is not much data or features, so they tend to overfit and fail to generalize on new data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Why good for problem**: First of all they are well suited for a classification problem, like the one we are approaching. DTs will also easily tell us which are the most important attributes that separate the two groups, which are the first nodes the tree seperates by, calculated with the information gain. This will make it easier to understand for scholars, who are not familiar with machine leanring algorithms, where action can be taken and will have the highest impact. Moreover we don't need to normalize data which will lead to use less resources (as asked) by the contractor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. _**Support Vector Machines**_:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example**: SVM is used in this example as a classificattion method to see whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues. ([See link)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012487302797) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Advantages**: Work well when there is a clear margin of separation between the classes. Moreover this separation doesn't necessarily have to be linear, as SVM supports kernels, so you can model even non-linear relations. Finally they maximize the margin, which makes them more robust and less likely to high have variance.\n",

    "    **Disadvantages**: They don't work well where there is a lot of noise in the data and when the target classes are very overlapping. Moreover, if the datasets are large their computation is cubic as a function of the size of the dataset, which makes it computationally expensive.\n",

So we would expect a better estimation with more data.\n",
